1.	How do I approach designing software?
o	What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

Before this project my experience with Visual Studio was limited. This project has helped me become more confident with VS. I also now have a better understanding of how lighting works in a scene. Before the project I had not done any work lighting a scene.

o	What design process did you follow for your project work?

For my project I tried to follow the process for designing software that I have learned previously. I tried to write clean code and follow industry best standards. 

o	How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

Tactics from my design approach will be helpful in the future by staying consistent. Consistently following the same design process will help be to develop software faster and reduce the errors.

3.	How do I approach developing programs?
o	What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

With this project I set up my systems as I developed the program. As I neared the finish of the project I added the rest of my scene. After I finished adding my items I reviewed the scene multiple times and made minor adjustments to finalize it.

o	How did iteration factor into your development?

Iteration helped me to space out the amount of time spent developing the program. I was able to build parts of the project and check the work for errors before continuing on to the next task. 

o	How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

My approach was to build the required systems at each milestone and test them. I wanted each part to be error free and developed cleanly. If I was satisfied I would continue to the next step. If in future milestones I felt something needed to change to improve the program I would go and make the changes.

5.	How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
o	How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

I will be able to take the skills built in this course and apply them to future course. This project has helped me to develop my skills a programmer. It has added new skills that will make my future classes easier.

o	How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

The skills I have learned from this course will help me with projects I will encounter in my future profession. I will be able to add value to any team I am placed with. I will be able to offer a wider range of abilities to my future employer.
